# Lynx
Lynx is a WIP Game Engine running on Vulkan.
Currently supports Windows.

## Requirements
- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.com) (not strictly required, however included setup scripts only support this)
- [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#windows) (preferably a recent version)

## Getting Started
Add this repository as a submodule to your project. Alternatively you can just unzip this repo into a subfolder named *Lynx*.
Run 'Lynx/CreateProject.bat' and enter your desired project name to genereate the project files. Once done open the solution and you should be greeted with a basic example .cpp file.
Simply compile and run :)
